# CaT Pipeline Configuration File
# -------------------------------------

# --- Core Paths ---
# workdir: The absolute path to your project.
#          All other paths below are relative to this directory.
#          Example: "/path/to/my/project"
#          Using "." means the directory where you run the script.
workdir: "." 

# spectra_file: Subdirectory *inside* workdir containing your spectra.
spectra_file: "R_8500"

# template_file: Path to the RV template file (without .fits extension).
template_file: "../rv_template/cat_template_rv"

# name_file: The base name for the output PDF and CSV files.
name_file: "output_test_8500"

# --- Input Table Configuration ---
# The master CSV/FITS file listing all your targets.
input_table: "test_input_8500.csv"

# Column name in your table for the unique Star ID.
col_id: "ID"

# Column name in your table for the spectrum filename.
col_filename: "file"

# Extension to append to filenames (e.g., ".fits").
# If your table already has the full filename (e.g., "star1.fits"),
# set this to null or an empty string "".
spectra_file_ext: ".fits"

# --- SNR Configuration ---
# Column name for the pre-calculated SNR.
# If you don't have this column, set it to null (or a name that doesn't exist).
col_snr: "snr"

# If 'true', the pipeline will run the der_snr algorithm
# on any star that is missing an SNR value in the table.
# If 'false', stars with missing SNR will be skipped.
compute_snr_if_missing: true

# --- RV Correction Configuration ---
# If 'true', the cross-correlation step is skipped, and
# the fit is performed on the observed-frame spectrum.
skip_rv_correction: true

# --- Pre-Normalization Configuration ---
# This step (based on IDL continuum.pro) runs *before* RV correction
# and is designed for unnormalized, raw spectra.
pre_normalization:
  # Set to 'true' to run this step, 'false' to skip it.
  apply: true
  
  # 'order' controls the normalization method:
  #   >= 0: N-th order polynomial (niter = # of iterations)
  #   -1:   Global median of the whole spectrum (niter is ignored)
  #   -0.5: Median filter (niter = filter width in pixels)
  #   -1 < order < 0: Percentile filter (niter = width; percentile = -order * 100)
  #   -2:   PEM (Piecewise) fit, 95th percentile (niter = # of pieces)
  #   -3:   Running average / smooth (niter = width)
  #   -150: PEM (Piecewise) fit, 50th percentile (niter = # of pieces)
  order: 2
  
  # 'niter' is a multi-purpose parameter:
  #   For order >= 0: Number of sigma-clipping iterations.
  #   For order -0.5, -3: Width of the filter in pixels.
  #   For order -2, -150: Number of pieces to split the spectrum into.
  niter: 5
  
  # Sigma rejection thresholds (only used for order >= 0)
  lowrej: 1.0
  highrej: 3.0

# --- Fitter Configuration ---
# Selects the wavelength bands for the *final* continuum
# fit and the line-fitting regions.
# Options: "cenarro2001", "battaglia2008", "armandroffzinn1988"
# You can also define your own custom dictionary here.
region_prescription: "cenarro2001"

# Selects the line profile to fit. Must match a key in
# PROFILE_REGISTRY in line_fitters.py.
# Default options: 'cole', 'gaussian', 'rutledge'
fitter_type: "cole" 

# --- Spectrum File Format Configuration ---
# 'format': 
#   'fits_primary': Standard FITS file (wavelength from WCS header)
#   'csv': CSV file (requires col_wave, col_flux)
#   'fits_bintable': FITS binary table (requires col_wave, col_flux)
#   'ascii': Any astropy-readable text file (requires col_wave, col_flux)
spectrum_config:
  format: "fits_primary"
  
  # --- Column names (ONLY used if format is not 'fits_primary') ---
  col_wave: "WAVELENGTH"
  col_flux: "FLUX"
  col_var: "VARIANCE" # (Optional) Column name for variance
